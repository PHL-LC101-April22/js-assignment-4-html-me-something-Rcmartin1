               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> Italy has always been a place on my bucket list to visit. I spent some time in the military and was finally able to go. In the year 2018 my dream came true. I went to Rome Italy, and Venice Italy. I took plenty of pictures, ate plenty of pasta, and drink more wine then I can remember.

                  The trip was not all pleasure because I was on the military's time so, I had to work during the day. I had most of the weekends to myself, but if duty called I would have to go.  However, I would trade my time for a vacation to Italy at any time.

                  During my time in Rome I was able to visit the Colosseum which is said to be the largest amphitheatre in the world. It was used for battles, and the killing of wild animals. I also did some souvenir shopping while there. I purchased some porcelain plates, scarves, and shirts.

                  I caught a train from my hotel to Venice and it took us four hours to get there. The buildings were very close together. We walked the small alleys to find a place to eat and came across some delicious pasta and seafood, but it was very expensive. There was plenty of jewelry, and clothing stores to choose from. We were so busy shopping that we missed the chance to ride the gondola which is a flat bottomed boat shown in most movies that are made in Italy. I would definitely visit again.
